# lstm-crf-with-batch_size
 
This code combines https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/nlp/advanced_tutorial.html with https://github.com/jidasheng/bi-lstm-crf.

It could realize the pos-tagging function with batched data.

Note, curently the model only deal with the input data  with the same length.
